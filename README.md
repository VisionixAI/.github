  <em>Smart actions through visual presence detection.</em>

**VisionixAI** is a computer vision platform for detecting presence in room zones and triggering automated responses — no sensors, no hardware dependencies.

We divide any room into **grid-based zones**. When a zone is unoccupied for a few seconds, we signal to shut off lights, fans, or other devices. When a person enters, we power it back on.  

All logic is controlled via a clean **CLI interface**, backed by AI vision models. Built for classrooms, offices, or any smart space.

We are currently developing:
- **CLI Tool** — stream video, detect zones, emit signals.
- **Core CV Model** — YOLO/MediaPipe-based zone presence detector.
- **API Layer** — for future integrations with apps, dashboards, and hardware.
